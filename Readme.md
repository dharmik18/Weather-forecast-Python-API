# Weather Application

This application provides real-time weather updates and displays images of cities based on user input. It uses PyQt5 for the GUI, and data is fetched using the OpenWeatherMap and Unsplash APIs.

 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- PyQt5 and requests libraries.
PyQt5==5.15.4
requests==2.25.1
I worked with Visual code for preparing this project. If the user is using the same platform they just need to run the .py file (lad_weather_app)
 Enter the city name and click on Get weather to get the weather details of the location.
 Also, you could clone the repository and simply execute the file.
